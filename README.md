# React Native Tutorial

---

This repo is from a tutorial off Udemy that I took to learn the basics of React Native. The main takeaways that I learned from this are:

- Styling with objects and flexbox
- React Native Components basics like _View_, _ScrollView_, _Touchables & buttons_, _Linking_, _Images_, etc
- React Native Cli
- React Native Debugging

**_Check out the components folder to see the code_**

The flow of the application comes from creating an "AlbumList" component that fetches data using axios and then feeds the album information down into sub components that display each album
